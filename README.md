# LioAnyShoulder
Musculoskeletal model for shoulder arthoplasty study using the AnyBody Modeling System software.

The **LioAnyShoulder** (FR: LioAnyEpaule) model consists in an inverse dynamic musculoskeletal model for shoulder griddle study. More specifically, it has been developed with the objective to be used for non-conforming total shoulder arthroplasty (NC-TSA) evaluation.  
Development, verification and validation of this model was one of the objectives of a PhD study. Method and results are published in the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering:
